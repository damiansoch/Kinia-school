          The Shih Tzu is a sturdy dog with a small muzzle and normally has
          large dark brown eyes. The Chinese have described their head shapes as
          "owl head" and "lion head", and their mouth as "frog mouths".[4] They
          have a soft and long double coat that will tangle and mat easily if
          not brushed at least every 2 or 3 days. A Shih Tzu should stand no
          more than 26.7cm (101‚ÅÑ2") at the withers and with an ideal weight of
          4.0 to 7.5kg (9 to 17 lb). Floppy ears are covered with long fur, and
          the heavily furred tail is carried curled over the back. The coat may
          be of any color, though white and with blazes of grey are frequently
          seen. A very noticeable feature is the underbite, which is required in
          the breed standard.[5] Because of their long coat and fast-growing
          hair, regular grooming is necessary, which may be expensive. The
          traditional long silky coat, which tends to reach the floor, requires
          daily brushing to avoid tangles. The coat can be clipped short to
          simplify care, but still requires frequent brushing. For showing, the
          coat must be left in its natural state, though trimming for neatness
          around the feet and anus is allowed. The shorter cut is typically
          called a "puppy cut"[6] or a "teddy bear cut" when the puppy cut is
          accompanied by a fuller, rounder face, resembling a stuffed animal.
